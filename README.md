Small example setup that builds an example with GLAD and GLFW on MacOS through the command line. I set this up to be able to run the code from https://learnopengl.com

# Setup
`brew install glfw3`

# Building
Just run `make`. You may need Mac's command line tools to be able to do this

# Running
Run the `start` program via `./start`
